Bijou.js is a library of super helpful JavaScript snippets! It has a bunch of
useful snippets for all your coding needs! If there's something that's not in
here currently but you use frequently, feel free to submit an issue! I'd be happy
to add it! Bijou's goal is to eliminate the need to copy paste the same thing
from StackOverflow, another project or anywhere else! So if you ever find
yourself typing the same thing over and over again, copy pasting the same
snippet as you did a few days ago, use Bijou.js! If the snippet you're using
isn't in Bijou.js, just submit an issue with the code!

# How to use Bijou.js

Thanks for using Bijou.js! It's pretty simple to use, but here's a guide:

## CDN

jsDelivr:
```js
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bijou.js@latest/bijou.js"></script>
```

UNPKG
```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bijou.js@latest/bijou.js"></script>
```

## `require()`
```js
const _$ = require("bijou.js");
```
# Usage
To use Bijou.js simply call one of the many functions built into it!

```js
_$.anyFunction(); //If you're using node you can name bijou anything.
```

Such as this one!

```js
_$.uuid(); //Results in something like this: c3435c88-0a20-491f-9391-3afde9c4a2d1
```

## Who made Bijou.js?

Me (@Explosion-Scratch) and my good friend @GrahamSH-LLK with a lot of help from other people such as retron and theColaber!

# Why use Bijou?

Well, a few reasons:

1. <s>I made it. ðŸ˜›</s>
2. It's useful! (If it's not useful just tell me what you want added in the
   issues tab! I'd be happy to add it!)
3. It's jam packed full of functions that are super useful but hard to think of!
4. 31 other people this month used it, so why shouldn't you?

<small>(You can probably see I'm pretty desperate for people to use
this.)</small>

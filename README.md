Congrats! You discovered Bijou.js! Read more below!

# What is Bijou.js?

Bijou.js is a library of super helpful JavaScript snippets! It has a bunch of
useful snippets for all your coding needs! If there's something that's not in
here currently but you use frequently, feel free to submit an issue! I'd be happy
to add it! Bijou's goal is to eliminate the need to copy paste the same thing
from StackOverflow, another project or anywhere else! So if you ever find
yourself typing the same thing over and over again, copy pasting the same
snippet as you did a few days ago, use Bijou.js! If the snippet you're using
isn't in Bijou.js, just submit an issue with the code!

# Why use Bijou?

Well, a few reasons:

1. <s>I made it. ðŸ˜›</s>
2. It's useful! (If it's not useful just tell me what you want added in the
   issues tab! I'd be happy to add it!)
3. It's jam packed full of functions that are super useful but hard to think of!
4. 31 other people this month used it, so why shouldn't you?

<small>(You can probably see I'm pretty desperate for people to use
this.)</small>

# How to use Bijou.js

Thanks for using Bijou.js! It's pretty simple to use, but here's a guide:

## Import it:

```html
<!-- Any of these (Don't do all of them lol) -->

<!-- jsDelivr -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/explosion-scratch/bijou.js@latest/bijou.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bijou.js@latest/bijou.js"></script>

<!-- UNPKG -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/bijou.js@latest/bijou.js"></script>

<!-- Or minified: -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/explosion-scratch/bijou.js@latest/bijou-min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bijou.js@latest/bijou-min.js"></script>
```

Also, did you know there's Bijou.css? It's also useful! It's all the stuff I
use:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/explosion-scratch/bijou.js@latest/bijou.css"
/>
```

it pretty much just uses classes.

## Basic usage:

### Import it

Browser:

```js
// You can use any of these to reference bijou:
// _ , _$ , explosion
// Or name it something different:
const this_is_bijou = _$;
```

NodeJS:

```js
const _$ = require("bijou.js"); //You can use any name
console.log(_$.primesTo(300)); //Logs all primes to 300
```

To use Bijou.js simply call one of the many functions built into it!

```js
_$.anyFunction(); //If you're using node you can name bijou anything.
```

Such as this one!

```js
_$.uuid(); //Results in something like this: c3435c88-0a20-491f-9391-3afde9c4a2d1
```

## Who made Bijou.js?

Me (@Explosion-Scratch) and my good friend @GrahamSH-LLK with a lot of help from other people such as retron and theColaber!

## Functions:

<details><summary>addStyles</summary><hr />
Add the styles in an object to a specified element:

```js
_$.addStyles(element, { background: "red" }); // (Changes the background color of the element to red!)
```

Also note that this only works when the property is camelCased, as in JavScript.
For example doing this:

```js
{"background-color": "red"}
```

would not work, but

```js
{
  backgroundColor: "red";
}
```

will work fine. Feel free to use

```js
_$.unCamelCase("CSS property name here").toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, "-");
```

to use css properties normally.

</details>

<details><summary>arrayToCSV</summary>

---

Returns a comma separated list from the specified array.

```js
_$.arrayToCSV([
  ["a", "b"],
  ["c", "d"],
]); //'"a","b" "c","d"' Note that this also escapes characters such as quotes.
```

</details>
<details><summary>async</summary>

---

Runs the given function in a web worker, returning a promise with the return
value. This is useful to prevent the main thread from becoming clogged while
trying to compute something.</details>

<details><summary>averageBy</summary>

---

This returns the average of an array based on the given function, for example:

```js
_$.averageBy([1, 2, 3, 4], (val) => val / 2); //Returns the average of each element after each element has been divided by 2.
```

</details>
<details><summary>browser</summary>

---

Returns the current browser without sniffing the user-agent string. e.g.
'Chrome'</details>

<details><summary>camelCase</summary>

---

Takes a string as an input and returns the camelCased version of it.

```js
_$.camelCase("Hello world"); //Returns "helloWorld"
```

</details>
<details><summary>compStyle</summary>

---

Returns an element of the computed style, e.g.

```js
_$.compStyle(document.querySelector("h1"), "background-color"); //Returns the background-color of the first &lt;h1&gt;
```

</details><details>
<summary>composeFunction</summary>

```

</details>
<details><summary>createElement</summary>

<details><summary>dayName</summary>

---

Returns the day of the week from a Date object.</details>

<details><summary>desktopOrMobile</summary>

</details>
<details>

```js
_$.drag(document.querySelector("div"));
```

</details>
<details><summary>each</summary>

```js
_$.each([1, 2, 3], (num) => alert(num * 3)); //Alerts each number in the array times 3
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>ease</summary>

---

The only non-function in Bijou.js. This has a variety of easing functions, all of which take a number between 0 and 1, and return a corresponding value for the easing function. For example this code:

```js
_$.ease.easeInOutQuad(0.3);
```

Would return the eased value for a point about a third of the way through the animation.

For reference here is the description of each function along with the equations for each of them:

```js
let ease = {
  // ----------------------------------------------------------------
  // Easing function descriptions
  // ----------------------------------------------------------------
  // To use each do _$.ease.linear([NUMBER BETWEEN 0 and 1 HERE])

  // no easing, no acceleration
  linear: (t) => t,
  // accelerating from zero velocity
  easeInQuad: (t) => t * t,
  // decelerating to zero velocity
  easeOutQuad: (t) => t * (2 - t),
  // acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
  easeInOutQuad: (t) => (t < 0.5 ? 2 * t * t : -1 + (4 - 2 * t) * t),
  // accelerating from zero velocity
  easeInCubic: (t) => t * t * t,
  // decelerating to zero velocity
  easeOutCubic: (t) => --t * t * t + 1,
  // acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
  easeInOutCubic: (t) =>
    t < 0.5 ? 4 * t * t * t : (t - 1) * (2 * t - 2) * (2 * t - 2) + 1,
  // accelerating from zero velocity
  easeInQuart: (t) => t * t * t * t,
  // decelerating to zero velocity
  easeOutQuart: (t) => 1 - --t * t * t * t,
  // acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
  easeInOutQuart: (t) =>
    t < 0.5 ? 8 * t * t * t * t : 1 - 8 * --t * t * t * t,
  // accelerating from zero velocity
  easeInQuint: (t) => t * t * t * t * t,
  // decelerating to zero velocity
  easeOutQuint: (t) => 1 + --t * t * t * t * t,
  // acceleration until halfway, then deceleration
  easeInOutQuint: (t) =>
    t < 0.5 ? 16 * t * t * t * t * t : 1 + 16 * --t * t * t * t * t,
